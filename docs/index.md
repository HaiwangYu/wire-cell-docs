This is the "production" version of Wire Cell.  It is a work in
progress meant to provide long term sustainable development on a
variety of computing architectures (uniproc, multiproc, HPC, GPU).
The concepts of the Wire Cell method are being developed in the
working prototype version.  See the
[Wire Cell home page](http://www.phy.bnl.gov/wire-cell/) for more
