#+TITLE: Wire Cell Toolkit Internals

* Intro

This doc describes the toolkit structure, not so much what it implements.

* Packages

** Dependencies

No ROOT in core.  core: =util= base, =iface= next. reference implementation: =gen=, =sigproc=, I/O or peripheral: =sst=.   Need for something between =iface= and ref. imp.

** Package structure

The =src=, =inc= etc dirs.  The =wscript_build= file.

** Build system

Not how to build but what developer needs to know to make a package comply.

* Interfaces

pure, abstract.  all in one package.

* Components

Pointer and shared vector access.  Named factory.

* Configuration

CPP macro.  interface methods.  common implementation patterns.

* Execution Models

** Ad-hoc

Direct calling of utility functions and concrete objects.

** Component

Concrete components.

** Interface

Using NamedFactory.

** Data flow programming

Using abstract DFP
