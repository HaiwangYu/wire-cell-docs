Wire Cell Toolkit provides some support for Python and requires it for some preprocessing, plotting and validation.  This support is held in the [[https://github.com/wirecell/wire-cell-python][wire-cell-python]] package

* Installing =wire-cell-python=

It's just a "normal" Python package.  Use your favorite method, such as

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ virtualenv --system-site-packages venv
  $ source venv/bin/activate
  $ git clone https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-python.git
  $ cd wire-cell-python/
  $ python setup.py develop  
  $ wirecell-sigproc --help
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Python command line programs

A number of python command line programs are provided.  They are typically named like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  wirecell-<name>
#+END_EXAMPLE
Where =<name>= is one a package short name (eg, =util=, =sigproc=, =gen=).

All use the same command line interface (CLI) module ([[http://click.pocoo.org][Click]]) so have similar usage.  In particular, run the program without any arguments to get a help screen.


* =wirecell= Python modules
#+BEGIN_SRC python :eval no
  from wirecell import units
#+END_SRC

** =sigproc=
*** =garfield=
