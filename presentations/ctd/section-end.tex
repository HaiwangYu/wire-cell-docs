  \frametitle{Summary}
  \footnotesize
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The \textbf{Wire Cell working prototype LArTPC reconstruction} method and software has been developed.
    \begin{itemize}  \footnotesize
    \item already producing some of the \textbf{world's best results},
    \item technical and performance improvements on-going.
    \end{itemize}
  \item The \textbf{Bee interactive 3D event visualization}
    application developed, critical for understanding LArTPC and
    developing Wire Cell.  Plans to evolve to ``human-directed
    automated reconstruction'' system.
  \item The \textbf{Wire Cell Toolkit} for LArTPC reconstruction
    partly complete and will be the basis for long term development
    including investigations into parallel processing.
  \item To be successful we must wade into \textbf{new waters} (for
    us) of parallel processing, hardware acceleration, computing
    science and mathematics.
  \end{itemize}
